# DISTANCE SENSING LED ARRAY

## Introduction
Welcome to the LED Distance Indicating Arduino project repository! In this project, we use an Arduino Uno board and an ultrasonic sensor to create a distance indicating system using LED lights.

## Arduino and Arduino Software
Arduino is an open-source electronics platform based on easy-to-use hardware and software. The Arduino Uno board is a popular choice for various projects due to its versatility and simplicity.

The Arduino Software, or Arduino IDE (Integrated Development Environment), is used to program the Arduino boards. It provides a user-friendly interface for writing, compiling, and uploading code to the Arduino hardware.

## Experiment Overview
The main goal of this experiment is to use an ultrasonic sensor to measure the distance of an object placed in front of it. As the distance decreases, LED lights connected to the Arduino board will illuminate, indicating proximity.

### Apparatus Required
- Arduino Uno Board
- Breadboards (quantity: 1)
- LED Lights (quantity: 7)
- 1K Ohm Resistors (quantity: 7)
- Ultrasonic Sensor
- Jumper Cables (As per requirement)

## Instructions
1. **Clone the Repository:**

2. **Install Arduino Software:**
Make sure you have the Arduino Software installed on your laptop or PC.

3. **Follow Experiment Videos:**
Find instructional videos in the "Experiment_Videos" folder to guide you through connecting the circuit and performing the experiment.

4. **Run the Code:**
Open the Arduino IDE, load the provided code from the repository, and upload it to your Arduino Uno board.
